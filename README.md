Healthcare is a field in which accurate records keeping, disease prediction and communication are critical and yet in which the use of computing and networking technology lags others fields.

Healthcare professional and patient are often uncomfortable with computer, and feel that computer is not central to their healthcare mission, even though they agree that accurate records keeping, disease prediction and communication are essential to good health care.

In current healthcare, information is conveyed form on healthcare professional to another through paper notes or personal communication.

For example, in the United States, electronic communication between physicians and pharmacists is not typically employed but, rather, the physician writes a prescription on paper and give it to the patient.

The patient carries the prescription to the pharmacy, waits in line to give it to a pharmacist, and waits for the pharmacist to fill the prescription.

To improve this process, the prescriptions could be

communicated electronically from the physician to the pharmacist, and the human computer interfaces for the physicians, nurses, pharmacists, and
other healthcare professionals could be voice enabled.



According to Carmen Catizone of the National Association of Boards of Pharmacy, there are as many as 7,000 deaths from incorrect prescriptions in the

United States each year.

A Washington Post article indicates that as many as 5 % of the 3 billion prescriptions filled each year are incorrect .

These numbers indicate that there is an urgent need to reduce the errors in healthcare.

It plays a critical role in maintaining and improving the health and wellbeing of people.

The healthcare industry is constantly evolving, and there is always a need for innovative solutions to meet the challenges it faces. This project aims to address some of healthcare challenges, explore the potential of AI in the healthcare sector and offer innovative solutions to improve healthcare delivery
