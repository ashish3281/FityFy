         WE ARE HERE FOR YOUR CARE
<h1>Introduction</h1>
<p>
Healthcare is a field in which accurate records keeping, disease prediction and
communication are critical and yet in which the use of computing and networking
technology lags others fields. Healthcare professional and patient are often
uncomfortable with computer, and feel that computer is not central to their healthcare
mission, even though they agree that accurate records keeping, disease prediction and
communication are essential to good health care. In current healthcare, information is
conveyed form on healthcare professional to another through paper notes or personal
communication. For example, in the United States, electronic communication between
physicians and pharmacists is not typically employed but, rather, the physician writes
a prescription on paper and give it to the patient. The patient carries the prescription
to the pharmacy, waits in line to give it to a pharmacist, and waits for the pharmacist
to fill the prescription. To improve this process, the prescriptions could be
communicated electronically from the physician to the pharmacist, and the
human computer interfaces for the physicians, nurses, pharmacists, and
other healthcare professionals could be voice enabled.<br>
 According to Carmen Catizone of the National Association of Boards of
Pharmacy, there are as many as 7,000 deaths from incorrect prescriptions in the
United States each year. A Washington Post article indicates that as many
as 5% of the 3 billion prescriptions filled each year are incorrect.
These numbers indicate that there is an urgent need to reduce the errors in
healthcare. It plays a critical role in maintaining and improving the health and
wellbeing of people. The healthcare industry is constantly evolving, and there is
always a need for innovative solutions to meet the challenges it faces. This project
aims to address some of healthcare challenges, explore the potential of AI in the
healthcare sector and offer innovative solutions to improve healthcare delivery

<li>High cost</li>
One of the primary challenges in the health care sector is the high cost of
medical care. Many people can not afford quality healthcare, and this limits
their access to essential services.
